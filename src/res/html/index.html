People are dropping by looking for a game, not finding anyone and leaving. It is recommend that those looking for games do so at the top of the hour and leave the game window open for a couple of minutes. The current Applet plays sounds to indicate people entering/leaving the lobby and games. This will allow you to leave the Applet up and <i>hear</i> when people join.

Confirmed: there <i>is</i> a major bug in Netscape 4.7 under MacOS 9.x that will crash your machine if you run the Scramble applet. It is safe and preferrable in this case to run Internet Explorer.

<tr><th>What is Scramble?</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scramble is a game of strategy, speed and knowledge, not luck or chance. Your sole objective is to collect the greatest number of tiles before the game clock expires.  Based on the SCRABBLE(TM) tile set, you compete in real time with other players to take dealt letters, re-arrange and steal words and defend your pile.

When you were younger, did you beat up other kids and take their lunch money?
Do you get a perverse sense of satisfaction from deflating people's egos?
Do you pride yourself on your extensive vocabulary?
 Ability to rearrange and decompose spatial relationships?
 Typing speed?
Do you value the relationships with your family, friends and colleagues?

<tr><th>How is the game played?</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a dealer (the computer) and up to four players.
There are 98 <i>tiles</i> using the same letter distribution as SCRABBLE(tm).
The dealer throws random tiles at a rate dictated by the chosen game speed.
The tiles appear in a <i>pot</i> at the top of the game window.
Your goal is to form words of three letters or more using tiles from the pot or other players word lists.
If you lose a word by making an error, those letter tiles go back to the dealer to be re-dealt.
A <i>"take"</i> is when you make a word from letters in the pot.
A <i>"steal"</i> is when you make a word using a word from another player.
A <i>"defend"</i> is when you make a word using a word from your own list.

<tr><td><p></td></tr>
<tr><th>What are the Rules?</th></tr>
<tr><td><ul>
<li>Words must be valid words of three or more letters from the game dictionary.
<li>Words must be comprised of letters obtained from the following
 <ul>
  <li>any number of letters from the pot
  <li>entire words from any player's word list
  <li>entire words from any player's word list + letters from the pot
  <li>any two complete words from players' word lists (not implemented)
 </ul>
<li>If you make one of the following errors, you lose your shortest word
 <ul>
  <li>enter an word that's not in the dictionary
  <li>enter an word that cannot be made from tiles that are showing
 </ul>
<li>You will not lose words during the End Game (see below)
<li>You cannot steal by making a word plural (adding an 'S')
</td></tr>

<tr><td><p></td></tr>
<tr><th>Strategy</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are numerous possible strategies and hybrid strategies.
The strategy you choose will likely depend on various factors:
 your typing speed, vocabulary and how much caffeine/alcohol you've imbibed.
Some people prefer to take words as fast as possible, others prefer to focus on stealing.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><p></td></tr>
<tr><th>End Game</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the dealer runs out of tiles, the game enters the "end game" phase.
A clock will begin counting down to zero at which point a winner or tie will be declared.
Any takes, steals or defends will reset the countdown.
During this time, you will not lose words by making errors.
The reason for this is that unscrupulous players may lose words on purpose to get those tiles re-dealt.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><p></td></tr>
<tr><th>Practical Limitations</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The game screen only has so much room for words and tiles.
The pot holds 52 of a possible 98 tiles.
In any normal game, this is not a problem since tiles get used so quickly.
If, however, you let the pot fill up and there are more tiles to be dealt, the count down clock will begin <i>without</i> entering the end game.
If no action is taken before the clock hits zero, a winner is declared.
If any letters are used from the pot, the dealer will reset the clock and start dealing again until the pot fills up or end game is entered.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Players are also limited to 24 words.
Again, this is only a practical limitation.
Once you reach 24 words, you are forced to compete on word length.
It is likely, though, that you have already crushed your competitors :)
</td></tr>

<tr><td><p></td></tr>
<tr><th>The Applet</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once the applet pops up, you will be anonymous until you give yourself a name by typing into the "Name" field and <i>hitting Enter</i>.
All players beyond the first four automatically become spectators.
The game will not start until <i>all</i> non-spectator players hit the "Start" button.
You submit a word to the dealer by typing into the "Word" field and <i>hitting Enter</i>.
The dealer will examine the word according to the rules at which point either a) it shows up in your word list, b) it doesn't or c) you lose a word.
You may also chat by typing into the "Chat" field and hitting Enter, but it's very unlikely you will have time during the game.
If all players click "Stop" during a game, the game will terminate immediately and declare a winner or tie.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Who can I blame for this?</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scramble is a game that we've played in our household and with friends and family since 1999.
We learned a variant of it from another friend that learned it on a trip to Singapore.
We've been refining and playing it ever since.
I initially started writing an online version of it both for the sheer challenge and to see if it could be translated to the digital world.
The game play around a table with friends and family can be intense and fierce.
The rules are slightly different from this online version, so I will post them later for those interested.
